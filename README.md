# 🔐 Password Strength Checker (Python)

This project is a **Password Strength Checker** built with Python.  
It evaluates a password based on five security criteria:
- Minimum length (8 characters)
- Contains uppercase letters
- Contains lowercase letters
- Contains numbers
- Contains special characters

It provides a score (0–5), percentage, and descriptive strength level (Very Weak → Very Strong), along with feedback on which criteria are satisfied.
